This website presents a semi-automated digital edition of letters and newsletters written and sent by Cosimo Bartoli to the Medici in Florence during his stay as their agent in Venice from 1562 to 1572.  
The edition is considered semi-automated because the documents were transcribed using the [Transkribus software](https://www.transkribus.org/). Some of the transcriptions, marked as “Reviewed,” have been manually corrected, while others remain unreviewed, with an accuracy rate of 96.80%.

## Cosimo Bartoli
<br>
Cosimo Bartoli (1503-1572) was a polymath and a complex figure: scholar, philosopher, mathematician, technician, courtier, and diplomat. He embodied the new figure of the intellectual, placing his vast theoretical knowledge, political intelligence and culture at the service of the Duke Cosimo I’ de Medici. Bartoli was deeply involved in the cultural life of his time, actively contributing to the founding and early activities of the Accademia Fiorentina. He is mainly known for his translation of Leon Battista Alberti’s _De Re Aedificatoria_ and for his long-standing friendship with the painter and architect Giorgio Vasari. In 1562, he was appointed by Duke Cosimo I as the Florentine agent in Venice, a crucial hub of information during the sixteenth century. His primary duty was to gather and relay information and news from Venice and beyond to Florence.

## Editorial Practices
<br>
The documents were transcribed automatically using the [Transkribus software](https://www.transkribus.org/). The text recognition model was specifically trained on documents written by Cosimo Bartoli and his son, Curzio Bartoli, resulting in a high degree of accuracy (96.80%). The trained model does not automatically expand abbreviations. A script was employed to replace the abbreviations with their expansions. The mdoel [Cosimo Bartoli’s Italian Humanistic and Cursive Scripts (1562-1572)](LINK) is publicly available and can be used by any registered Transkribus user.
<br>
Each letter and newsletter is treated as an individual document. The transcriptions can be browsed on the [Home page](LINK) or searched by keyword on the [Search page](LINK).
<br>
The documents are categorized into three genres: Letter, Newsletter, and Other. The “Other” category includes documents that contained information attached to a letter but did not follow the traditional form of a newsletter, lacking a hub and date. Each document includes metadata at the top, followed by the transcription. The metadata fields are divided by genre:
<br>
| Genre       | Metadata                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Letter      | Document Type, Shelfmark, Date, Place, Sender, Recipient, Attached Newsletter, Reviewed |
| Newsletter  | Document Type, Shelfmark, Hubs, Writer, Attached Letter, Reviewed        |
| Other       | Document Type: Other, Shelfmark, Title, Attached to, Reviewed            |
<br>
The “Attached Newsletter” and “Attached Letter” fields link to the corresponding newsletter or letter, respectively. The “Reviewed” field indicates whether I have personally reviewed the transcription or if it remains as the automatic transcription generated by Transkribus, which may be less accurate.
